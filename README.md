You can do a git clone, or download the file.  You will need node installed.  With node installed you can go to the directory with the server.js in the command line.  Use <npm init -y> then <npm i express> to install Express.  To run the server use <npm start>

## Mock Up

When you type in a note, a save button will appear.  Clicking on the botton will move the note to the json.  Delete button doesn't work yet.
